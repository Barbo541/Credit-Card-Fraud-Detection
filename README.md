# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Introduction

This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Using a real-world dataset, we preprocess the data, train a model, optimize it, and evaluate its performance.

## Project Structure

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for model training, evaluation, and deployment.
- **data/**: Example dataset files (note: no sensitive data included).
- **images/**: Visualizations and figures used in the documentation.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to install the required libraries. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
